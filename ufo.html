							<h2>UFO Sightings Project</h2>
							<h3>The Relationship Between UFOs, Location, Time, and Human Emotion</h3>
							<p> Link to project repository on <a href="https://github.com/johannaschmidle/UFO-Project">GitHub</a> 
						</header>
						<p>This project is inspired by the project that sparked my interest in data analysis. The original project was done in R and it remains my favourite school project to this day. My professor even used it (and still uses it) as an example of a good project when teaching this class. <br />
                            <br />
                            In this rendition of the project, I took the same UFO Sightings database and re-cleaned and re-analyzed it with my new skills. This project has two parts
                            <ul>
								<li>
									Part 1:<a href="https://github.com/johannaschmidle/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/UFO_Project_Part1.sql" target="_blank"> General Data Cleaning in SQL</a> 
								</li>

									Part 2:<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/johannaschmidle7/ufo-project-part-2/notebook" target="_blank"> EDA and Data Visualization</a>
								</li>
                            </ul>

					<h2>Summary of Findings:</h2>
					<p>The full summary can be found at the bottom of my <a href="https://github.com/johannaschmidle/UFO-Project/blob/main/UFO_Project_Part2_Python.ipynb" target="_blank">project file</a>.</p>
					<h3>Time</h3>
					<h4>Sightings and Reporting Over the Years</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Over time there is an increase in UFO <strong>sighting</strong> rates, likely due to internet access, pop culture events, and conspiracy theories.</li>
						<li>Over the years <strong>reporting</strong> rates fluctuate. Spikes, such as around 2012, may be due to specific events like the end-of-the-world theory.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Findings:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Large spike in sightings and reportings after 1995.</li>
								<li>Significant activity in Canada (2003-2007).</li>
								<li>Spike around 2012.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Reporting Delays</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Most post about an encounter immediately.</li>
						<li>Reporting delays differ by country. Germany takes the longest, the UK the quickest. The US takes surprisingly long.</li>
						<li>Different UFO shapes affect reporting delay. Distinct shapes prompt quicker reports; general shapes take longer.</li>
						<li>Strong emotions like happiness, fear, and anger lead to quicker reports.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Findings:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Fastest to slowest reporting time (Countries): UK, Canada, Australia, US, Germany.</li>
								<li>Fastest to slowest reporting time (Emotions): Angry, Happy, Fear, Sad, Surprise.</li>
								<li>Distinct shapes were reported fastest; general shapes were reported slowest.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Location</h3>
					<h4>Sightings on a World Map</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Sightings are concentrated in first-world countries, especially along coastlines.</li>
						<li>Areas where sightings are sparse show clusters of sightings.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Findings:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Aliens prefer coastal areas.</li>
								<li>Clustering suggests aliens are real.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Sightings vs Time of Year (Northern and Southern Hemisphere)</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Sightings are most frequent in the <strong>northern hemisphere</strong> during <em>June</em>, July, August, and September.</li>
						<li>Sightings are most frequent in the <strong>southern hemisphere</strong> during January, March, <em>June</em>, and December.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Findings:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>June is the most popular month for sightings.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Human Emotion (Includes Sentiment)</h3>
					<h4>Location and Sentiment</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Negative and positive sentiments are more concentrated in popular areas; neutral sentiments are more spread out.</li>
						<li>Sentiments are distributed similarly across different countries.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Findings:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Most to least popular sentiment: Neutral, Positive, Negative.</li>
								<li>UK and Canada have the highest positive sentiments.</li>
								<li>Australia has the highest negative sentiments.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Location and Emotion</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Emotions appear randomly spread out on a world map, with clusters of surprised people in the US and Europe.</li>
						<li>Happiness is the most popular emotion in every country; surprise is the least popular.</li>
						<li>Emotion are distributed similarly across different countries.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Findings:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Emotions ranked: Happy, Scared, Angry, Sad, Surprised.</li>
								<li><strong>Happy</strong>: Most in Germany, least in Australia & US.</li>
								<li><strong>Fear</strong>: Most in the US, least in the UK.</li>
								<li><strong>Angry</strong>: Most in Germany.</li>
								<li><strong>Sad</strong>: Most in Canada.</li>
								<li><strong>Surprise</strong>: Least in the UK.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h4>Feelings about UFO Shapes</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Most shapes elicit neutral sentiments; diamond shapes are an exception.</li>
						<li>When it comes to shape and emotions, the results are consistent with sentiment findings; flashes elicit neutral reactions.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Findings:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Shape "light" has the highest positive sentiment.</li>
								<li>Diamond shapes are likely to get positive reactions.</li>
								<li>Teardrop shapes elicit mixed reactions.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>Comment Analysis</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Light, object, and sky are the <strong>most</strong> used words to describe UFO encounters.</li>
						<li>The top 5 words are similar across countries.</li>
						<li>The top 5 words reveal more information about UFOs. They provide insights into the color and motion of UFOs.</li>
						<li> 
							<strong>Findings:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>UFOs often move quickly.</li>
								<li>Common colors: orange, white, red.</li>
								<li>Sightings often occur at night.</li>
								<li>UFOs can be large.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<h2>Recommendations and Next Steps</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Investigate more detailed temporal patterns, such as sightings during specific holidays, weekends, or significant cultural events.</li>
						<li>Implement machine learning models to predict the likelihood of sightings based on historical data and external factors.</li>
						<li>Use clustering algorithms to identify and categorize different types of UFO sightings.</li>
					</ul>
