							<h2>Analyzing Book Sales</h2>
							<h3>Insights into Author Popularity and Trends</h3>
							<p> Link to project repository on <a href="https://github.com/johannaschmidle/BookAuthors">GitHub</a> 
						</header>
						<p>This project is inspired by my love of reading. I wanted to explore a database of book sales information, with a particular focus on books released after the year 2000. More specifically, I was curious about author information (I wanted to see how my favourite authors are doing). I wanted get insights about an authors popularity, general rating, and sales trends. I used excel to perform a general cleaning of the database and then developed an interactive dashboard to present my findings. 
						<h4>Metrics and Dimensions</h4>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Average Book Rating:</strong> The average rating given to the book by readers</li>
								<li><strong>Units Sold:</strong> Total number of copies sold</li>
								<li><strong>Gross Sales:</strong> The total sales revenue generated by each book</li>
								<li><strong>Publisher Revenue:</strong> The revenue earned by publishers from selling each book</li>
							</ul>
